allergy_score
=============

This is an epicodus assignment

An allergy score is a single number that tells what someone is allergic to. The scores for each allergen are:

allergen     score
eggs         1
peanuts      2
shellfish    4
strawberries 8
tomatoes     16
chocolate    32
pollen       64
cats         128
So if someone is allergic to eggs and strawberries, they get a score of 9.

Write a method that takes someones score as an argument, and returns an array listing what they're allergic to.
